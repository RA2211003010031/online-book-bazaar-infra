## 🎯 Video Recording Script (15-20 minutes total)

### 🎬 Introduction (2-3 minutes)

**[Screen: AWS Console showing 3 instances]**

> "Hello! Today I'm demonstrating a complete DevOps implementation for our Online Book Bazaar project. My teacher required a collaborative development setup with 3 EC2 instances for team members, and I've enhanced it with modern DevOps tools."

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Explain the educational context
- Show 3 running EC2 instances in AWS
- Mention collaborative + DevOps enhancement approach
- Overview of tools to be demonstrated

**[Transition to terminal/browser]**

### 🤝 Phase 1: Collaborative Development Setup (3-4 minutes)

**[SSH into Instance 1]**
```bash
ssh -i team-key-mumbai.pem ubuntu@[instance1-ip]
```

> "First, let me show the collaborative development environment. Each team member has their own identical EC2 instance."

**Demonstrate:**
```bash
# Show project structure
cd ~/projects/online-book-bazaar
ls -la
tree . -L 2

# Show Git setup
git status
git log --oneline -5
git remote -v

# Show development tools installed
node --version
npm --version
docker --version
```

**[SSH into Instance 2 and 3 briefly]**

> "As you can see, each instance has the identical setup, allowing seamless team collaboration."

**Key Points:**
- Identical environments prevent "works on my machine" issues
- Git workflow enables proper version control
- Remote development capabilities

---

### 🐳 Phase 2: Docker Containerization (3-4 minutes)

**[Back to Instance 1]**

> "Now let's see how Docker containerizes our application for consistent deployment."

**Demonstrate:**
```bash
# Show Dockerfile
cat Dockerfile

# Show docker-compose configuration
cat docker-compose.yml

# Build the application
docker build -t online-book-bazaar .

# Show images
docker images

# Run the containerized application
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name book-app online-book-bazaar

# Verify container is running
docker ps

# Show application logs
docker logs book-app
```

**[Switch to browser: http://instance1-ip:3000]**

> "And here's our containerized application running perfectly!"

**Key Points:**
- Containerization ensures consistent environments
- Easy deployment across different systems
- Isolation and security benefits

---

### 🔧 Phase 3: Ansible Automation (3-4 minutes)

**[Back to terminal on Instance 1]**

> "Next is Ansible for automation. Instead of manually deploying to each instance, let's automate it."

**Demonstrate:**
```bash
# Show Ansible setup
cd ~/ansible-devops
ls -la

# Show inventory configuration
cat inventory/hosts.ini

# Test connectivity to all instances
ansible -i inventory/hosts.ini all -m ping

# Show the deployment playbook
cat playbooks/deploy-app.yml

# Run automated deployment
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/deploy-app.yml
```

**[Switch between browser tabs showing all 3 instances]**

> "Watch as Ansible automatically deploys our application to all instances simultaneously!"

**Key Points:**
- Eliminates manual, repetitive tasks
- Ensures consistent configuration
- Scales easily to many servers

---

### 🔄 Phase 4: Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline (4-5 minutes)

**[Switch to browser: Jenkins URL]**

> "Now for continuous integration and deployment with Jenkins."

**Demonstrate:**
1. **Show Jenkins Dashboard**
   - Navigate through interface
   - Explain pipeline concept

2. **Create New Pipeline Job**
   - "New Item" → Pipeline
   - Name: "BookBazaar-Deploy"
   - Configure Git repository
   - Point to Jenkinsfile

3. **Show Jenkinsfile**
   ```bash
   # In terminal, show the pipeline configuration
   cat ~/projects/online-book-bazaar/Jenkinsfile
   ```

4. **Trigger Build**
   - Click "Build Now"
   - Show build progress
   - Explain each pipeline stage

5. **Show Build Logs**
   - Console output
   - Success/failure indication

**Key Points:**
- Automated testing and deployment
- Consistent build process
- Integration with Git for automatic triggers

---

### 📊 Phase 5: Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana (3-4 minutes)

**[Switch to browser: Prometheus URL]**

> "Monitoring is crucial for production systems. Let's see Prometheus collecting metrics."

**Demonstrate Prometheus:**
- Show targets page (Status → Targets)
- Run sample queries:
  - `up` (show which services are up)
  - `node_cpu_seconds_total` (CPU metrics)
  - `container_memory_usage_bytes` (memory usage)

**[Switch to Grafana URL]**

> "Grafana visualizes these metrics in beautiful dashboards."

**Demonstrate Grafana:**
1. **Login** (admin/admin)
2. **Add Data Source**
   - Configuration → Data Sources
   - Add Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
3. **Create Simple Dashboard**
   - New Dashboard → Add Query
   - Show system metrics visualization
4. **Explain Real-time Monitoring**

**Key Points:**
- Proactive monitoring prevents issues
- Real-time visibility into system health
- Alert capabilities for critical events

### 🚀 Phase 6: Live Deployment Demo (2-3 minutes)

**[Back to terminal on Instance 1]**

> "Let's demonstrate the complete DevOps workflow with a live code change."

**Demonstrate:**
```bash
# Make a visible change
cd ~/projects/online-book-bazaar
nano public/index.html  # Change title or add text

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Demo: Update application title for DevOps demo"
git push origin main
```

**[Switch to Jenkins]**

> "Watch Jenkins automatically detect the change and deploy it!"

**Show:**
- Jenkins automatically triggering build
- Pipeline execution in real-time
- Deployment logs

**[Switch between application URLs]**

> "And there's our change, automatically deployed across all instances!"

**Key Points:**
- Complete automation from code to production
- Fast feedback loop
- Reduced human error
